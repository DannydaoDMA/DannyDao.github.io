                <p class="hero__description"> 
                  Based in the Bay Area, Danny Dao has a creative approach to the technical and artistic aspects of crafting visuals and imagery. His work spans from generative art to audiovisual
                  effects and projection mapping. Originally a choreography dancer since 2014, Danny's passion for music has blended his musicality with innovative visuals through time and space. With
                  a good eye for immersive and interactive environments, his art bridges the gap between the common issues found in everyday life and what it takes to get through them by incorporating
                  reality, dreams and technology together. <br> <br>

                  While attending San Jose State University, Danny has collaborated with the CADRE Student Organization as vice president to provide opportunities for creative exploration, learning, and
                  collaboration among Digital Media artists and enthusiasts.

                            of sight and sound. While working on this piece, I was interested in the idea behind black holes and how we as humans get sucked into the idea of passion. 
                            This piece is a representation of my start into the world of digital media. The <b><i>Singularity</i></b> draws you in, and asks you to think of the bigger picture.

                            <b><i>The Poster Within A Poster</i></b> is a replication and admiration for graphic designer, Neville Brody. This poster recreates the themes of punk rock, dadaism, and pop art;
                            themes of which Neville Brody were influenced by. I wanted to make a poster that would put Neville Brody out in the limelight. In a world where graphic design is becoming more prominent, this poster
                            changes the population's perspective of advertisement. Instead of advertising a product or corporation, this poster strives to advertise a person of significant importance or better yet, the person behind the job.

                            "The only thing granted equally to all is an unfair reality." A quote taken from a character from <i>Jujutsu Kaisen</i> whose sister was unfairly cursed despite virtually being a good person.
                            At that time of my life, I watched a close friend struggle as she fell into a state of misery and depression. Our perspectives were polar opposites. I would often talk about my accomplishments while she would
                            often talk about her struggles. For her, she was blinded by failure and often told by others that she was not good enough. My inspiration for this piece came from countless hard months of hard conversations and questions
                            to myself. Are our paths different because of our circumstances or is it because of something deeper than that? When are we able to understand each other? This piece uncovers the perspectives of two very different people,
                            one that sees everything, the endless possibilites, and the other who sees very little.

                            Welcome to Saturn, a planet filled with unknown possibilities. <i>Bubble Pop: Picnic On Saturn</i> is set in a 3D environment with interactivity to enable motion and control inside the space. The title of 
                            the piece is split into two different names. <i>Picnic on Saturn</i> is a song produced by a good friend of mine which is currently in development. When asked about the song, Nate mentioned that, "The goal was to create a song
                            that would emulate the idea of what it would be like to have a picnic on Saturn." I pushed this concept further by incorporating a story of the alien lifeform known as <i>Bubble Pop</i>. When combining the two different worlds between
                            music and art, a story is told through visual and audio immersion creating an environment only possible through net art.

                            While scrambling through an old high school backpack, I came across random items that I had not cleaned out. This is a representation of some of the most important memories I had from my childhood.

                            I often think that I resemble most like a butterfly. My ability to change and evolve as a person in order to understand the world better has allowed me the sense of liberation and the ability
                            to let go of burdens. This piece is a reminder to pursue happiness because one life is all we have.

                            CADRE S.O. presents <i>Fever Dream</i> and <i>Bubble Pop: Picnic on Saturn</i> at Subzero Festival. The exhibition presents two highly interactive projects on the two day weekend. Both projects were exhibited
                            through projection mapping and interaction through a MIDI keyboard and the Xbox Kinect.

                    While driving to work on a Monday morning, the sad news of Bay Area’s Hit Music Station Wild 94.9’s host, Jeffrey Vandergrift’s (JV) potential suicide in San Francisco Bay, sent me a reminder of how much of a part we play in each other’s lives. The news provoked memories of laughter filling the car on some really tough days and I would always think about how happy and positive he was and how that inspired me to do the same. The hands are a mold of my own hands set to remind me of what I can I do to prevent further suicides from happening.
