                            <b><i>Singularity</i></b> is an audiovisual spectacle made with the concept of pushing the concepts of algorithms to create a video that pertains to the human senses
                            of sight and sound. The <b><i></i>Singularity</i></b> draws you in, and asks you to think of the bigger picture.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Whie exploring algorithms in the P5js website, my interest in audiovisuals inspired me to compile the two into a video. <b><i>Singularity</i></b> was coded using P5js, then compiled in Processing,
                            and finally, edited in Adobe Premiere. I used my knowledge of vector movement code to move various algorithms across the canvas while implementing tools such as translate, scale, and rotate within push and pop
                            to change the algorithms accordingly. Counters were used to increase the movement in the algorithms and translucency gave the overall video a ghostlike effect. All visuals were done in P5js while Adobe Premiere Pro was used to
                            integrate fades, a title, and credits.

                            <b><i>The Poster Within A Poster</i></b> is a replication and admiration for graphic designer, Neville Brody. This poster recreates the themes of punk rock, dadaism, and pop art;
                            themes of which Neville Brody were influenced by. I wanted to make a poster that would put Neville Brody out in the limelight. In a world where graphic design is becoming more prominent, this poster
                            changes the population's perspective of advertisement. Instead of advertising a product or corporation, this poster strives to advertise a person of significant importance or better yet, the person behind the job.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            This poster recreates an image of Neville Brody by using vector programs inside Adobe Illustrator. I used various shapes and lines to outline an existing image of Neville Brody. I then shaded
                            each and every closed shape according to the original image, thus creating different shades of black. Fonts were used in Adobe Illustrator and were chosen based on the fonts that Brody had created which also replicated 
                            his style of work. The included images were taken from Brody and placed into Adobe Photoshop to create a poster. By recreating and representing someone in the graphic design world, I am able to show not just a product, but 
                            the source of the material which therefore yields a different result then what may be expected.

                            <b><i>Reminder: Think Of A Title</i></b> is about diving deep into what it is like for a person with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); the idea that having one simple task can constitute many other different tasks. The perspective is shown through a part of the day on the computer, setting reminders for tasks, while getting distracted by the evolving technological advances that make it more difficult for people with ADHD.

                            <br>
                            For this project, I wanted to dive deep into exploring how hard it is for people with ADHD to do their daily things. I do not have ADHD, however, I do know a lot of people that struggle with it. In this project, I did a lot of research and learned that technology makes it very difficult for people with ADHD to do their tasks as they get sidetracked by a lot of the “pop-ups” that technology in computers and phones have to offer. I wanted to explore the idea of overlapping audio to create a simulation of what it is like inside a person’s mind with ADHD.

                            My exploration in P5js led me to create an interactive painting tool. This painting tool is an allusion to "prison art" and what artists do when they are confined to a space with a limited set of tools. Try out each brush and see what you can create!

                    While driving to work on a Monday morning, the sad news of Bay Area’s Hit Music Station Wild 94.9’s host, Jeffrey Vandergrift’s (JV) potential suicide in San Francisco Bay, sent me a reminder of how much of a part we play in each other’s lives. The news provoked memories of laughter filling the car on some really tough days and I would always think about how happy and positive he was and how that inspired me to do the same. The hands are a mold of my own hands set to remind me of what I can I do to prevent further suicides from happening.
